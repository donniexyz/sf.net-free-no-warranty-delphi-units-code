Using ASCII Tables with Delphi
-------------------------------
Delphi supports using ASCII text files as tables, with limited 
functionality.  ASCII tables are intended for exporting
and importing data to and from other formats--in general, they are 
not recommended for use as data sources for applications.

Each ASCII table requires a data file (generally with .TXT 
extension) and a schema file (with the same base file name 
and .SCH extension). The schema file contains information about 
the structure of the table and the datatypes of its columns (fields).  

ASCII tables are always opened for exclusive access.  In other
words, no more than one application (session) can access an 
ASCII table at one time.  If you have opened an ASCII table at
design time, you must close it before running your application
that opens the table at run time.

Copying a table to ASCII format with Database Desktop or a TBatchmove
component will automatically create a schema file as well as the 
ASCII data file.  ASCII tables are always created with FIXED filetype.
When creating an ASCII table with Delphi (for example with BatchMove 
or CreateTable methods), you must specify TableType as ttASCII.  You 
should not leave TableType as ttDefault.

ASCII tables do not support the following:
* Indexes (and therefore, any methods or functions that require an
  index, such as GoToKey, SetRange, etc.)
* TQuery components (SQL)
* Deleting records
* Inserting records.  Insert always appends the record to the end 
  of the table.
* Referential Integrity
* Blob datatypes
* DELIMITED tables do not allow modification (editing) of records

The Schema File
---------------
All information in the schema file is case-insensitive.
Here is a sample of what a schema file looks like:

[CUSTOMER]  	      		// File name with no extension.
FILETYPE = VARYING 		// Format: VARYING or FIXED
CHARSET = ascii			// Language driver name.
DELIMITER = "        		// Delimiter for char fields.
SEPARATOR = ,	     		// Separator character 
Field1 = Name,CHAR,12,0,0	// Field information
Field2 = Salary,FLOAT,8,2,12 	

The schema file has a format similar to Windows INI files.
The file begins with the name of the table in brackets.
The second line specifies the file format following the 
keyword FILETYPE: FIXED or VARYING.
* In a FIXED format file, each field always takes up a fixed
  number of characters in the file, and the data is padded with
  blanks as needed. 
* In a VARYING file, each field takes a variable number of characters,
  each character field is enclosed by DELIMITER characters, and the 
  fields are separated by a SEPARATOR character.  The DELIMITER and 
  SEPARATOR must be specified for a VARYING format file, but
  not for a FIXED format file.

The CHARSET attribute specifies the name of the language
driver to use.  This is the base file name of the .LD
file used for localization purposes.

The remaining lines specify the attributes of the table's 
fields (columns). Each line must begin with "Fieldx = ", 
where x is the field number (i.e. Field1, Field2, and so on).
Then comes a comma-delimited list specifying:
* Field name - Same restrictions as Paradox field names.
* Datatype - The field data type.  See below.
* Number of characters or units.  Must be <= 20 for numeric
  data types.  Total maximum number of characters for date/time 
  datatypes (including / and : separators).
* Number of digits after the decimal (FLOAT only).
* Offset - Number of characters from the beginning of the line
  that the field begins.  Used for FIXED format only.

The following data types are supported:
CHAR - Character
FLOAT - 64-bit floating point
NUMBER - 16-bit integer
BOOL - Boolean (T or F)
LONGINT - 32-bit long integer
DATE - Date field.  Format specified by IDAPI.CFG
TIME - Time field. Format specified by IDAPI.CFG
TIMESTAMP - Date + Time field. Format specified by IDAPI.CFG

NOTE: You can specify Date and time formats in the BDE configuration 
utility
