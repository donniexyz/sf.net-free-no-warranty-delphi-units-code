The sole purpose of this "1" folder is to hold clones of individual units which are required in other projects.

Using subversion, it is possible to import shared units from another svn repository using the Externals feature.
However, one can only import entire folders, not individual files, when crossing repo borders.
However, within a single repo, one can "external" a single file.

Cloning the units into their own subfolder lets us keep a single master copy while making important units 
available for easy use in other projects.
